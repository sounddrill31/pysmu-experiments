************************

Important Note: 
This program needs exclusive access to the ADALM1000 to function properly.
Pixelpulse / ALICE etc should not be open when running this program.
This program might not work properly with other versions of python. Its tested on Python ver 3.10.10 only, currently.
If the ADALM1000 is not found connected to USB, this program simply exits.
This is the Windows-64 bit version. Email me for Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi versions with your OS name and version.

Pre-requisites and install instructions - Windows-64bit :
This program needs Python 3.10.10 and libsmu with pysmu python bindings installed properly on your Windows computer.

************************

Download link: 
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.10/python-3.10.10-amd64.exe
Run above exe file setup / installer : python version 3.10.10

**** VERY IMPORTANT ****

Special care care has to be taken while installing Python 3.10.10
First uninstall any older versions of python in your computer.
Then while installing python ensure every check box is checked.
At the beginning, there is a check box to install python in the Windows Path. Very important to check this box.
Then select custom installation, and check every box before proceeding.
The after installing python, REBOOT the computer before you proceed further.....

************************

Next install libsmu
https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libsmu/releases/download/v1.0.4/libsmu-1.0.4-setup-x64.exe
Run above exe file setup / installer : libsmu 1.0.4

************************

To install the pysmu python bindings, just run this at the command prompt:

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pysmu

You must be able to see pysmu 1.0.4 when you run this at the command prompt:

pip list

************************

Download the whl file from this repo's whl folder, to your local computer.
ar_iitm = Aditya Rao IIT Madras control transfer python library for the ADALM1000
This wheel file will be updated regularly with more functionality, and is platform independent.

install the ar_iitm-1.0-py3-none-any.whl wheel file using the command:

pip install ar_iitm-1.0-py3-none-any.whl

************************

Connect the PIO1 pin to your chip's clock pin (eg. Pin 2 of the 74LS163)
Connect the GND pin to the chip's ground. (eg. Pin 8 of the 74LS163)

How to use :
After all the installations just connect the ADALM1000 to USB port and run this program.

To run this program, just execute clock.exe at the command prompt, or click on the 'clock' executable file.

The blue notification LED will blink every second when the 1 Hz clock signal is being generated successfully.
